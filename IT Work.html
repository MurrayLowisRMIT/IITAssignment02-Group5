		<h1>Interview With Pizza Hut's Front End Lead Developer</h1>

		<h2>Report</h2>
		<h3>Foreword</h3>
		<p>The interview was conducted with John Hemans of Pizza Hut Australia using Zoom. Total recording was approximately 15 minutes. There may be some slight errors in the transcript which do not change the meaning of the sentences within which they occurred. Sound and video recordings available upon request.
		</p>

		<h3>Review</h3>
		<p>John Hemans is the main front end developer for Pizza Hut Australia. He mainly works with other IT people, and Pizza Hut’s marketing department, the latter of which seem to present a challenge at times (this was not stated but inferred from nonverbal communication).
		</p><p>He meets with marketing once a fortnight and they came up in a few of the questions. Apart from the expected work of making a large company web site with a high volume of traffic run smoothly and do everything the customer would like, a lot of work has gone in to making the web site configurable to people within the company such as marketing and people further up the leadership hierarchy.
		</p><p>Apart from the above, a lot of the work is debugging. One major project was implementing a debugging interface which acts to catch bugs customers run into and provides the IT team with information about them in real time.

		<h2>Transcript</h2>
		<p class="quote">Could you please tell me about your IT work, what industry you work in, and what exactly you do?
		</p><p>I work in the IT industry, specifically at the moment I’m in the IT department at Pizza Hut, and my job role is the web developer. I work on the front end of Pizza Hut’s forward-facing web site, as well as a few backend related tasks and some private facing websites for the company.
		</p><p class="quote">Can you tell me who you work with mostly, is it mainly IT people or other people, and what sort of IT people do you work with? 
		</p><p>For the most part I work with the IT team, my co-workers, which currently consists of a DevOps person, a Systems Architect who mostly decides what systems we will be working on and maintaining for future projects, a backend developer, and then a data management team. So that’s the main people I work with. Also every two weeks we hold meetings with the marketing team to demo what we’ve done and the features we’re providing, and we work closely with them about what they want to see on the web site. So they’re the main two, we occasionally work with the finance team when we’re working on financial systems to make sure everything’s running smoothly. A few departments but mainly I work with IT and the marketing team. 
		</p><p class="quote">What sort of work do you have to do?
		</p><p>So the majority of the work involves implementing new features on the web site, so whenever a request comes through from marketing or my superiors I develop those features on the web site, as well as tests to go with those features and unit tests. That would usually be on a Javascript framework. ViewJS at the moment is the framework we use, which I am specialised in. Occasionally I work on the backend which runs an AWS service which uses some C# code. So we manage a set of APIs on the web site, so I’ll develop on the front and I’ll develop a set of APIs which the front end will require on the web site, so whether that’s a product management API or an order system API or whatever is required on the front end to communicate with our back end systems. 
		</p><p class="quote">What’s it like to work with the IT people? 
		</p><p>My experience at Pizza Hut has been overall positive, I’ve been very lucky to work there. As a university student myself I started out there as a junior developer in sort of an intern position just learning the ropes. I had a mentor who showed me how certain things worked. Very lucky, and the set of systems they’re dealing with, working with Amazon so it’s a very modern system they’re working with on a day to day basis so I get to learn new technologies which I can use in a future job, so in that I am very lucky to work with them. Getting to work with enterprise business is a real eye opener for if I want to continue down this job line in future. Covid-19 has made things quite interesting with working in the office making it all remote work. We did work from home a couple of days previously so the adjustment to that has been easier than for some of the other departments. We work it out with our major communication device being Slack where we hold meetings through that now. 
		</p><p class="quote">What’s it like to work with the marketing people? 
		</p><p>It can be interesting (laughing). I won’t say anything bad about them, but they keep us on our toes. Occasionally I will be directly contacted by marketing for things they want to see on the web site since they know I’m in charge of it. We try to keep things to a system so that if they request something on the web site it goes through a product owner who creates a ticket which will get estimated by the team of how much work is involved, then it gets assigned to either me or one of the other developers. That’s the proper process so whether it sticks like that or not changes, but we try to meet their needs in a systematic approach so that things get deployed on time and meet certain goals, so yes it’s interesting working with them. The IT team sticks to an Agile methodology while the marketing team has their own practices which don’t always align themselves with how we plan our sprints or assign tasks so a marketing requirement might have a feature come up on the same day that they require to be implemented the next day or within that week so that’s where systems kind of clash between departments, but we come to a bit of an understanding of each other’s systems and a bit of compromise.
		</p><p class="quote">What do you spend the most time on?
		</p><p>It can change day to day, week to week. Some weeks we spend most of the time cracking down on bugs on the web site that our users or the marketing team or our own team have found. Time can be invested in investigating that bug, in where the issue lies, fixing it and developing the relevant tests so that bug doesn’t show itself in the future so that we don’t have any regressions on the web site. So that can be very time consuming. In an ideal world I’d spend most of my time creating new features on the web site, whether that is a new payment system like Google Pay or Apple Pay, or making a better user experience on the web site, so slightly tweaking things on the web site that we think will give a better user experience, or implementing order history so making it that you can access that order history through the phone or through the web site, so the majority of my time I spend on the web site fixing bugs or implementing features. 
		</p><p class="quote">What do you find the most challenging? Is it the debugging?
		</p><p>Debugging can be challenging. It’s still a learning experience with finding the best ways to catch certain bugs beforehand, or for them never to appear in the first place. Recently I implemented an error catching system on the web site which catches errors users find on the web site in real time and reports them back to us. It then helps us find what line of the code the bug may have occurred to and who may have committed it to our repository so we can send someone to investigate and fix that. So debugging can be the most challenging part of my job and especially high priority bugs. Also learning new technologies the business requires and working with other third party businesses to implement those technologies, so Google or Apple, and some of the time zone differences between those people can increase communication times so that deadlines can be missed, so I can send an email during the day and it will take 12 to 14 hours for them to get back to me and the same happens again so working with other businesses with new technology can be one of the most challenging things. Challenging but rewarding when you fix that bug and learn from your mistake or meet new people and contacts through these new businesses and learn new technologies. 
		</p><p class="quote">Can you give me an example of something in your work that you feel encapsulates the IT industry? 
		</p><p>I can think of some of the large things I’ve worked on that other IT companies would have done as well. There was implementing a content management system so that marketing can make changes to the web site themselves, which other companies would have to do for their clients as well. A majority would have used Wordpress but if you have a custom platform you have to implement a custom solution, so making sure marketing requirements are met and also good practices are followed with what exactly can be managed. That was one of the projects I worked on which was interesting and challenging but ultimately provided a lot of value to the company.
