		<h1>Aquarium Climate Control System</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>While there are many unique ways to successfully maintain an aquarium, there are even more ways to poorly maintain an aquarium. Poor maintenance leads to unhealthy tank conditions and stress, sickness, or death for its inhabitants.
		</p>

			<div><p><strong>‘Green water’ caused by ammonia build up and exposure to too much light [40]</strong></h2></div>
		</div>
		
		<p>One of the main causes of poorly maintained tanks is user ignorance. Very often aquariums become unhealthy simply because its carer does not understand the needs of their tank, introduces incompatible tank mates, or does not have the means to conduct proper maintenance. Another cause of poor conditions is the sheer effort often required for proper maintenance.
		</p><p>Our group project idea is to develop a climate control system for household aquariums to mitigate these problems.
		</p><p>This climate control system would incorporate several mechanisms and sensors working in tandem to gauge and maintain the biological health of an aquarium, as well as interactive software to provide relevant information to the user. These would all be connected to a central control hub directly controllable by the user.
		</p><p>This system would allow a degree of independence for the tank by automating many responsibilities and otherwise advising the user when their direct intervention is required. This will greatly ease the workload and streamline maintenance.
		</p><p>As a starting point, the physical system would support multiple variants of the following types of instrument:

				<li><p>Thermometers</p>
				<li><p>Filters</p>
				<li><p>Lights</p>
				<li><p>Timers</p>
			</ul><ul class="projectList">

				<li><p>Aerators</p>
				<li><p>Chemical concentration monitors</p>
				<li><p>Chemical release instruments </p>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>A modular design would mean that support for additional instruments could be added as they are conceived.
		</p><p>These components would be interchangeable as necessary to maintain parameters set by the user based on the specific needs of their tank and the desired degree of automation. Integrating these modules into a universal control hub will allow a tank to manage many parameters independently and otherwise provide feedback to the user when their direct intervention is required.
		</p><p>Supporting these instruments would be a digital encyclopedia built into the hub device. This would detail requirements for various species and guides for proven aquarium strategies. This would provide all the information up front to a user allowing them to make informed decisions about what livestock their existing set up can support, as well as how to manage the system once it is up and running. Alternatively, the guides could be used to instruct new aquarium set ups based on proven techniques.
		</p><p>This project would improve the capability of novice aquarium owners to maintain healthy tank conditions. Automating many of the manual obligations in conjunction with the information provided by the app would also enable them to try some of the more complicated types of aquarium builds.
		</p><p>For more invested enthusiasts, the automation would help to save time on the more menial tasks such as regular manual testing and allow them to focus more on the more exciting aspects of the hobby like aqua-scaping or breeding. It will also help mitigate deterioration when other obligations get in the way of tank maintenance. The app could also be used as a source of inspiration for new and interesting aquarium ideas.

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This project is built around two primary components: the physical hub onto which all the other instruments would be connected, and the encyclopaedic software to allow the user to plan/manage their aquarium and provide feedback on tank conditions.
		</p><p>The hub would be a custom-built computer with several multipurpose ports to allow for the docking of the different physical instruments. Modules could be bundled with hub or come separately depending on the nature of the set up the user desired.
		</p><p>The instruments themselves can be classified into two main categories: standard and specialised. Standard modules would include the likes of lights, heaters, and aerators that either perform a constant operation or could be operated simply with an on off switch. While complex higher functions would be possible for some of these, for simple usage scenarios they could be interchangeable with any 3rd party alternative.
		</p><p>Specialised modules would include those with more complicated functions such as water chemistry monitors/control mechanisms and mechanical reservoirs. These would require greater input from the control hub based on measurements from the other instruments for proper operation.
		</p><p>Animal and plant feeders would also function quite simplistically via timers. These would be configured to release defined portions of either solids or chemicals stored in refillable containers.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Standard Instruments</h3>
		<p>The most fundamental modules would be heaters/thermometers which should generally be included in most aquariums in some form. Heaters will need to be made available in different sizes/wattages to suit tank dimensions and ambient temperature. Different types are also possible (suspended heating elements, underground heat mats etc.) depending on cosmetic preference, affordability, tank requirements etc.
		</p><p>Filters are generally the next most fundamental component, used to maintain water quality. It is possible in more advanced set ups to omit a mechanical filter provided the tank is otherwise biologically filtered through heavy plantation and bottom feeding livestock like shrimp, snails, or catfish. More complicated filter usage scenarios are detailed under specialised instruments.
		</p><p>Basic aerators can typically be configured once and left to operate indefinitely. Whether it be an air-stone creating bubbles that rupture at the water surface or a continuous waterfall (which can be combined with a filter), these generally work through the same principle of agitating the water surface to entrain oxygen. 
		</p><p>Basic lighting is very commonly used to accentuate aquariums, however full spectrum lighting is essential for planted tanks to sustain plant growth. These can be paired with timers to set appropriate intervals to maintain balance between plant growth, limiting algal blooms, and aquarium aesthetics at peak viewing times throughout the day. Wattage and active schedule could be adjustable depending on the dimensions of the tank and species housed.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Specialised Instruments</h3>
		<p>More advanced filter usage could be regulated by the hub via timers and sensor readings to toggle the filter on and off or limit flow rate depending on water hygiene. Keeping filters off when not needed will help maintain food supply for plants and bottom feeders.
		</p><p>Automated water reservoirs or ballast tanks could be combined with water level sensors to account for evaporated water and maintain the water level. While far from compulsory, such systems would reduce the workload associated with manual water changes and top ups. It would also be possible to tie these mechanisms in with the outlets for filters/aerators.
		</p><p>It would be possible for water chemistry parameters such as pH and water hardness (dissolved minerals) to be monitored with appropriate sensors. These could then be either regulated with motorised chemical release systems or otherwise the data provided as feedback to the user for manual intervention.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Software</h3>
		<p>The hardware would all be built around the universal hub which would operate on custom made software. The hub itself would need to be able to take direct input from the user to control its functionality and provide feedback which could be done with interactive touch screen technology.
		</p><p>This software would need to be able to process inputs from the user and various sensors to control the relevant instruments and automatically adjust aquarium conditions. It would also need to be configurable to different combinations of instruments due to the modular design.
		</p><p>In addition to controlling the physical components of the system, the hub would also be programmed with an expansive encyclopaedia covering species’ habitation requirements and tank mate compatibility. It would also contain stencil guides for various proven set up methodologies which can then be tailored to suit the needs of the intended inhabitants and user preferences. These would range from simple light, heater, and filter systems to near autonomous systems using every one of these modules.
		</p><p>It would also be possible for a version of the encyclopaedic component of this software to be made available as a companion smartphone app or computer program.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Development in Assignment 3</h2>
		<p>While the construction of the physical components would currently be beyond the capability of our team and would need additional tools and expertise, we would certainly be able to start developing the software to control the hub.
		</p><p>Specifically, we may be able to program simple operations for the control hub to take inputs from the sensors and output commands to the various modules. We would also be able to start compiling the user interface and encyclopaedia for a limited number of species and aquarium set up guides.
		</p><p>For the physical components we would likely be able to at least come up with some generalised designs and determine how they could be incorporated into the overall build. We would be able to account for such design choices as water proofing, component orientation of devices and other cursory considerations.
