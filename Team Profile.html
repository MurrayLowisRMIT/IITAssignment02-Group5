		Decisive, efficient, and systematic
		Dedicated and responsible
		Strong-willed
		Natural leaders
		Organized and reliable
		Value tradition and stability
		Committed, trustworthy, and honest
		Enthusiastic, outgoing, and friendly
		I'm not sure how helpful this test really is. While I am trustworthy, and honest, and usually committed, especially in this degree, the world would be in great trouble if this only applied to 7% of the population, and I'm not convinced it applies to all 7% of the population that are ESTJs. Also experience tells me (and previous tests) that I'm on the dividing line between Extrovert and Introvert.

		Learning Style Test
		http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml
		What's Your Learning Style? The Results

		Your Scores:

		Auditory: 60%
		Visual: 25%
		Tactile: 15%
		You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.

		Auditory
		If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.

		As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.

		Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.

		Sit where you can hear.
		Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
		Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
		Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
		Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
		Have test questions read to you out loud.
		Study new material by reading it out loud.
		Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.

		Once again, I've been sitting up the front of classrooms and lecture halls since the early years of high school. What started initially as a way to compensate for undiagnosed short sightedness has become a habit as I've become more aware of the benefits, such as most students who sit up the front are pretty keen and less likely to talk through the lecture.

		IQ Test
		https://intellitest.me/en/knowledge/FKEVK/start?gclid=CjwKCAjwt-L2BRA_EiwAacX32ZGDJ42BbvUPAbsiDCjgF3JoYrXkph9bF-tWF1AR5aZmPr57oNZvGBoCgiMQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=9910358&utm_content=free+iq+test+online&utm_medium=gad_as-1_us-uk-ca-au_pho-tab-web_40q_iq_int&utm_source=62
		Your IQ score is 130
		Congratulations, your IQ classification is gifted. People who score within the 120-140 range fall into the top 14% of our users. This means that your reasoning and overall mental agility place you above average.

		Your IQ classification is derived from the total score you achieved in the different areas of testing. These scores are totalled and then compared with the rest of our users. An average score is 100. Where you fall on the IQ scale is how you compare to all other users. In this case, that is above the average.

		When people make a big deal out of IQ scores I am reminded of an experiment one of my teachers was involved in while they were at university. A group of researchers came up with an IQ test aimed at African Americans living in Harlem, but they had made it too easy and the control group were getting scores of 180-240. When my teacher did it he got an IQ score of 40 in this test, and the highest in his class got 60. He had an IQ of 140 and the person who got 60 had an IQ of 160 in a regular IQ tests. Also if asked the question which of these is not like the others and you had a seal, a shark, an orca, and a tiger, a regular IQ test may well say the shark as it is not a mammal, or the tiger as it doesn't live in the water, but someone from a hunter gather society may say the seal as it is not a predator.

		What this means for me and my group
		What it means for me
		While I don't disagree with the description of myself that the Meyers-Briggs Test comes up with, I'm not sure how useful they are for someone who knows themself well. They may be helpful to someone hiring people who has to assess a lot of people they don't know quickly, or for a young person who doesn't know themself that well. It's pretty positive so I don't think it's a problem for job interviews if they test me. The learning style test doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already suspect. IQ tests suffer from problems of cultural bias, although this works in my favour as I am of the culture the tests are aimed at.

		My behaviour in the group
		For a group it indicates I should be an asset to them. Being organised and natural leader, combined with my experience with HTML and programming should make it easy for me to find people who would like to join forces. I hope to be able to help the team out a lot. Although my ESTJ profile says I'm a natural leader, this is not a position I gravitate towards as it takes a lot of work to do well. All the groups I've been in at university before didn't have a leader and just worked cooperatively anyway.

		Forming a group
		I hope to find a group with a few other people with some IT skills and one or two people who could do with a helping hand, without the IT background &/or for whom English is not their first language. I hope to do very well in this subject so I would hope the majority of the group can all pull their weight easily, but I also hope to help others along the way.</p>
	
		<h2>Marcus</h2>
	
		<p>Myer’s Briggs Test: This test gave me an ISTP profile, meaning I am introverted, sensing, thiking and perceiving. 
		What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I like to work predominantly alone as I m introverted however I am also able to be open minded and work in teams if need be. 
		How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team scenario I won’t be the one to put my hand up as leader or organiser, I am more than happy to be assigned a task and complete that as much as I can alone. 
		How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I think I should look for people that are more extroverted as we may work well together as they may be much more comfortable to talk and take a leadership position and delegate roles. I won’t argue with them as much as to extroverts together would.

		Learning Style Test: This test told me that I am predominantly a Visual learner. This means that I learn by reading or seeing things rather than listening or doing. 
		What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I would need to learn through visualising, reading, seeing. 
		How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? I think in a team scenario it would be better for someone to show me what they have done instead of explain it. 
		How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team it would be best to team with people who learn in a similar way and that way we would all be on the same page and know what eachother needs to learn and work effectively as a team.

		Big Five Personality Test: This test gave me the highest scores in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness, while giving me low scores in Extroversion and Neuroticism. 
		What do the results of these tests mean for you? To me this test outlines that I am easy going and generally not too fussed about things. I am however quite introverted as explained by the low score in extroversion. 
		How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team I am not one to argue and am generally happy to do what the team wants. I will put my opinions out there is asked but won’t usually speak if I dont fell that I need to. 
		How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I would look again for people that are more extroverted but are also open and conscientious. I would avoid people with high scores in neuroticism.
	
		Knowing the above information may help the team to understand why I may not include myself in conversations quite as much. I may need a nudge from time to time and to be prompted to respond rather than giving my opinion without being asked. </p>

		<p>16 Personalities - Myers-Briggs test

		INTP-T - Logician

		This result demonstrates particularly strong introversion as well as a preference for theoretical and rational thinking as opposed to practical or emotional thinking.

		In a team environment, logicians' intuitive (N) and prospecting (P) traits lead to focus on exploring every possibility and testing new ideas rather than unilateral decision making. This can be beneficial to a team in coming up with creative solutions to problems but can also have the disadvantage of time wasted on excessive deliberating or pursuing impractical goals.

		The introverted (I) trait means logicians prefer to carry out the bulk of their workload alone, using team mates more for brainstorming or to help troubleshoot a problem. While this grants a level of independence, it also creates potential for a disconnect with overall team objectives which can be avoided with casual regular check ins with teammates.

		The thinking (T) trait entails a logical (rather than emotional) approach to situations. While an advantage when handling logical challenges, it can also lead to conflict within teams due to a lack of empathy or consideration for others' ideas or values.

		To make full use of the logician skill set it can be effective to pair with a more pragmatic team member such as those with the judging (J) trait. This will help capture good ideas and but also keep the focus on the task at hand instead of allowing excessive deliberating to waste time.

		Mint HR - Learning style test
		Reflector: 18/20
		Theorist: 15/20
		Pragmatist: 8/20
		Activist: 8/20

		This result aligns with the Myers-Briggs 'logician' result, reiterating the preference to observe and analyse. New tasks are best approached by taking a process apart piece by piece and testing each step along the way.

		This means that when handling something new, additional time should be allocated to explore in greater depth and understand every step along the way. Skimming details or being forced to simply accept facts without explanation could lead to apprehension in following conventional methods.

		Reflective/theoretical learners are therefore likely to have a good understanding of the fundamentals which can be used to devise creative new solutions, however this may come at the cost of difficulty working within predefined customs.

		In a team, such individuals may benefit from working on narrower yet less explored areas of a topic where there are likely to be fewer inhibiting predefined conventions. This will allow them to take advantage of their understanding of fundamentals to solve problems in creative ways others may not have the patience for.

		Big Five Personality Test
		Openness to experience: 51%
		Conscientiousness: 29%
		Extraversion: 1%
		Agreeableness: 46%
		Natural reactions: 47%

		These results show generally middle of the road attitudes with the exceptions of below average conscientiousness and extremely low extraversion.

		As with results from the previous tests, low extraversion suggests a preference for solitary working conditions ideally tempered with routine check ins with team members.

		Low conscientiousness reinforces a preference for freedom or flexibility and an aversion to stifling conventions.</p>
	
	
		<h2>Ossama</h2>
	
		<p>At the completion of the Myers-Briggs personality test I was identified as an ENFP personality type. This was no surprise to me as I have done this test, however on a different website, before in the past and was familiar with all of the 16 personality types. I also completed a learning style test as well as the ‘Big 5 Personality’ test. This result and subsequent information detailing the personality type falls in line with my own understanding of myself. Such as my proclivity to think abstractly or to often focus more on feeling rather than logic. This aspect of my personality is likely what served me well in customer service roles in the past. However, I understand the validity of the Myers-Briggs personality type theory has been questioned by many and so I don’t take the results too literally. From experience in working as part of a team, my extraversion and feeling first tendencies have helped me foster a positive and welcoming environment however not necessarily always a productive one. This has been a process I have tried to change in the past about my ability to be a productive member of a team, to varied success. My result in the learning style test however took me by complete surprise, indicating that I scored 45% as an auditory learner, 35% tactile and 20% visual. I was expecting to score much higher in visual learning with the majority being tactile. I am not sure what led me to think of my own learning properties as such but in learning of the reality it makes sense to me. I very often understand things through speaking them and I tend to recite mathematical equations in my head rather than visualizing them. I also get distracted by background noise very easily and struggle to focus in anything less than complete silence. Learning of my auditory advantage I plan on utilizing it with new study strategies and new ways to take in information. This test has been extremely useful for me and I am glad it has been included as part of the curriculum. Keeping this in mind is something I strive to achieve as I move closer to my first group project of the course. A comfortable social environment is important as is the equal workload and symmetry of a team and I hope to foster such an environment in the projects forthcoming. Providing plenty of opportunities to discuss the course material or assessment material within the groups will prove extremely useful to someone as a predominantly auditory learner such as myself. This is a strategy I plan on bringing with me into assessment 2 and beyond. The ‘Big 5’ personality test also provided me with useful information to carry forth with. I scored extremely high in trait Openness and extremely low in Conscientiousness which indicates a mix of positives and negatives to my personality as a team player. Openness governs the ability to think laterally and creatively to solve complex problems however leaves you wanting in the concentration and day to day determination department. Individuals high in Openness tend to be easily sidetracked, too caught up in the big picture, impulsive and can be unreliable in pursuit of a long-term goal. Simply being aware of something is usually the first step in solving an issue, therefore the knowing of potential pitfalls and traps can help someone remain productive in the face of their own trait disadvantage. Embracing effective means to maintain self-motivation will be my own way of mitigating this.</p>

		<p>Myers-Briggs Personality Index : INFJ INFJ Summary

		Learning Style Test :

		Auditory: 40%
		Visual: 45%
		Tactile: 15%
		Take The Test
		Big Five Personality Test

		Open-Mindedness-You enjoy having novel experiences and seeing things in new ways.
		Conscientiousness-You are well-organized, and are reliable.
		Conscientiousness-You are well-organized, and are reliable.
		Extraversion-You are extremely outgoing, social, and energetic.
		Agreeableness-You find it easy to express irritation with others.
		Negative Emotionality-You aren't particularly nervous, nor calm.
		Take The Test

		What do the results of these tests mean for you?

		After taking these tests I can surmise that tests such as these can produce varying results depending on the questions asked. For example, in the Myers-Briggs Index I showed signs of Introversion, while the Big 5 Test pointed toward more Extroverted traits. Having taken these tests before, which rendered a different result yet again, I can assume that either the test results change, as the individual grows and adapts to different personalities, or that one frame of mind may lead to different resuts than another eg. tired, stressed, hungover. In any case, these tests should be taken with a degree skeptisism and not as the sole arbiter of personality.

		How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

		While these tests may help those discover more about their personality, or reinforce their already held beliefs, care must be taken to recognise the cookie cutter format of these tests. Conversely, these tests may foster some confidence in an individual, allowing them to read and recognise patterns in their group work or leadership style. This aids them to further develop theses skills.

		How should you take this into account when forming a team?

		As mentioned before, not too much faith should be put in a simple online test to build a personality profile. When forming a team, many variables can effect the success or failure of the working relationships. While they aren't perfect, these personality tests may open a dialog, in which team members may express their preferences related to group work, mangement styles and how they prefer to absorb information.</p>

		<p>As part of this project I conducted the following tests:
		• Myers-Briggs Test Link
		• Learning Style Test Link
		• Creativity Test Link

		Myers-Briggs

		The results from the Myers Brigs test was (the following was taken here):

		A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. Making up only 4% of the population, these rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, imaginative, and apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.

		source: imgur.com

		Learning Style

		The results from the Learning Style test was (the following was taken from here):
		A This preference uses your experiences and the things that are real even when they are shown as images and on screens.
		• Your notes may be poor because the topics were not “concrete” or “relevant“. So expand them into a learnable package. Then reduce them from three pages down to one page.
		• Put plenty of examples into your notes and answers.
		• Remember the “real” things that happened. Search for the reality and the applications of ideas.
		• Go back to the laboratory or your laboratory manual or your practical notes. Recall the experiments and field visits where you learned.
		• Find pictures and photographs that illustrate an abstract idea, theory or principle.
		• Talk about your notes with another person with a Kinesthetic preference.
		• Use previous exam, assessment and test papers.
		• Role-play the test situation in your own study room.
		• You want to experience the exam so that you can understand it; recall previous examinations, especially those were you did well.

		Creativity Test

		The results from the Creativity Test can be seen below (the following w as taken here):

		source: imgur.com

		What do the results of these tests mean for you?
		It is clear to me that I am not a traditional learning, I can be very creative but also doing standard book learning exercises is not my ideal method. I work well in teams and can be very inclusive and attentive to others needs.

		How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
		I really can work with most groups and can be a good leader or follower, I am good communicator and can bring people along the journey.

		How should you take this into account when forming a team?
		A group should form with different personalities and mixing the workload to fit each person. Being inclusive and understanding of skills and prefered tasks will be critical to success.</p>

		<h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
	
		<h2>Joe</h2>
	
		<p>I was unable to find any job adverts online that were remotely like my ideal job, so I created a fictional job advert for a real company:

		Captiv iOS developer ad (fake)
		Captiv. Captiv is a small French company of 11 people (or at least that's the Gaspard team) making IT products, including for the disability services market. It's products include a sensor mat for wheelchairs that communicates with an iPhone to warn when you are in danger of developing a bedsore and 5 other functions (called Gaspard) and an temperature/humidity/pressure sensor that communicates with your iPhone.

		Position: Captiv is looking for experienced iOS Mobile Devs with a passion for quality, a passion for innovation, and a passion to learn. You would be working on our Gaspard product. This is my ideal job as my desire is to work making life richer for people with disabilities.

		A few years experience with iOS and programming in Swift. You must be able to demonstrate several iOS apps you have written. The ideal applicant will have fluent French. Some experience in engineering and web design would be a bonus.

		I have basic French (formerly intermediate) and several months experience writing apps for iOS in Swift. I have 89% of an engineering degree and basic web design capabilities. I'm practicing my French once a week with a friend and at some point I'll take a 2 week holiday to Vanuatu for an immersive French experience once my French is good enough (it involves staying with a family who don't speak English and is subsidised by the French government).

		I plan on taking the iPhone Software Engineering elective as part of my Bachelor of IT, as well as Further Programming, Programming Principles 2A and Object-Oriented Programming in C++, and taking UNIX System Administration as a free elective and a 2nd semester French subject as my other elective. I plan on working on making some abandonware games accessible to people with disabilities as well as making them available to modern OSs, MacOS, iOS, Windows and Linux, as projects while I complete my degree.</p>

		<p>http://www.belmores.com.au/files/docs/financial%20planner.pdf 
		This position is for a financial planner who helps people generally of older ages prepare and build savings for retirement, as well as assist with younger families with things such as budgeting and superannuation. This is appealing to me as it is the profession I am looking to go into once I complete my bachelor’s degree in business and financial planning. 	

		Ideally to get to this position I would need some years experience in the financial planning field and also be able to help the business grow with new business. Currently I am working as a paraplanner in a financial planning firm and have been for 3 years. I have no other experience which is why I am studying in order to gain knowledge towards my goal. I am currently studying part time and have 4 years of part time study left. I plan to keep working in and around the financial planning field as a paraplanner and also continue my studies and therefore once completed my degree I will have a large amount of experience and hopefully be much more employable than another graduate with little to no eperience.</p>

		<p>Listing:
		https://www.seek.com.au/job/50104621?type=standard#searchRequestToken=43f85981-b008-4663-942b-755c89acaf36

		This is an example of a software engineer job listing with a tech company specialising in customised software for its clients. In addition to producing and marketing their own software they also provide ongoing support with onboarding and rolling out updates based on client feedback. The role itself requires familiarity with several programming languages, and the ability to interact constructively with both clients and colleagues, to identify ways to improve their product.

		The role interests me as it sounds like it will allow a degree of creative freedom in software design. A set list of outcomes is provided by the company itself or by a client, a general set of programming guidelines is set out for streamlining integration with the work of others, otherwise the design approach is at the discretion of the software engineer. Creative freedom is one of the things I am most interested in when it comes to advancing my IT career and as such this could be a fitting role.

		This role would require developing fluency in a range of programming languages as a starting point, and the drive to continue exploring them and developing smarter solutions. It also requires the ability to communicate constructively with clients and colleagues to figure out new ways to improve their product.
		
		Experience from my education and previous career in engineering/project management gives me a good starting point for the requisite communication skills for this role. My previous communication experience however has been more tailored towards conveying information rather than a two-way exchange. I will need to continue to build and use receptive communication skills to meet the requirements of such a position. Naturally, this position would also require a great deal of study into programming languages and techniques. I hope to further build on both skill groups through course material and cooperative group work within this course, as well as over the course of any undergraduate and post-graduate work experience. Short term undergraduate work, casual work or even freelance projects could also help provide experience to bolster my application.</p>

		<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50055762?type=standard#searchRequestToken=3158af8e-bac8-449e-b9a3-a2d33abe4a82 Based on a good amount of customer service-related roles I have enjoyed in the past I would like to take my experience and expertise with me into my IT career. Given a solid understanding of the IT world I believe I would greatly enjoy a role such as this one. To work directly with customers or clients with tech issues and to solve problems and help people I believe would be a very rewarding experience. This role is a desktop and application support position in which they are looking for an applicant to maintain and manage any IT related issues that come forth. They have a very large team at their head office (I used to work for the company and went there for numerous reasons during my tenure) and they require someone to join their small team of Level 2 IT support specialists to oversee their computing operation in house as well as remote support to the numerous chain businesses all over South Australia. I recall the software they used for their POS was very prone to issues so I can see their crucial need for IT staff. This type of role is extremely interesting to me as someone who enjoys working in a team, enjoys helping people and enjoys solving problems. This particular company has been known to aggressively expand so opportunities for consultation and computing setup in the various stores is very likely an additional duty that would present itself from time to time. For this position they require tertiary qualifications or adequate experience in a similar role. They find knowledge in the Microsoft programs such as Outlook, PowerPoint, Word etc. to be very advantageous as well as knowledge of cloud computing. They expect basic knowledge of IP networking and printer setups. I have a relatively firm grasp on most of the Office suit of programs however I fall short on all the other particulars. My plan is to reach beyond an area of basic competency in these aspects to thrive in a position such as this one. Of most of those requirements, I hope to achieve them within the material of this course. As of now I am unsure on how I would go about achieving a great understanding of printer setups and how they work outside of the software that governs it. There are a few resources available online that would help get me there such as this one. https://computer.howstuffworks.com/inkjet-printer.htm I am also unsure of whether this would classify as an entry level position or not. The option between relevant experience or tertiary education tells me that knowledge of these languages and software could potentially mark one as a successful candidate. If that is true than I may find myself applying for a job such as this with just a couple of years of this bachelor under my belt.</p>
	
	
		<h2>Torin</h2>
	
		<p>The job listing I found was for Technology Lead with an SaaS company on the Gold Coast. The position calls for someone who has 10 years of experience in Software Development, with management experience to match. The role involves several programs which will likely be utilised as work commences. These include AWS, PHP, Java and React. The succesful applicant must have experience with a "start-up" or similar business venture. On top of the technical and managerial skills, they must have an artistic flair, as the position will involve making decisions concerned with design and architecture.

		Currently my experience is limited to cursory studies in coding and graphic design. Neither of these are accredited by any institution and my experience is less than two years in each of the fields.

		To follow the path of this career I would need to continue my study to attain a Bachelor of IT from RMIT, in which time I would hope to network with some career professionals and attain an entry level position in a start-up endeavour. After staying with a particular company for a number of years, I would progress to Tech Lead, a promotion I would keep for a minimum of 10 years. During this time, I would hone my skills and gather experience in hands-on coding, design and team management. After this time, I will have accrued enough knowledge to approach the technology job market with a pragmatic and holistic approach, which this role requires.</p>

		<p>•The job is based around bring business units togther under one goal of data transparency. It is a complete process for a digitalization overhaul, working from desing to implementation and ongoing management. It would be a very technical role but mixed with a large change management process. You would need to convice many parties of the benefit, create a solution that can be utilized across divisions and then implement the value of having data from all divisions using analytics.
		I am interested in this role because it lends to my exisiting skill set, future skils I am currently building but most importantly my interest in Digitalization.
		Experience required is the following:
		• Executive level exposure, on sales, reporting and management.
		• Design, development and validation experience on a digitalization strategy with analytics.
		• Engineering and Integration experience with clouod solutions like AWS/Azure with analytics roll out, including onprem to cloud solutions.
		• Creating a comprehensive and clear communication message to work with a diverse set of team members.

		My experience covers the following:
		• In my three previous roles I was reporting to the executive level both on the client side and internally. I understand the need to cater the message appropriately, how to sell an idea, address issues before they become problems and report on success.
		• My current role involves creating, implementing and rolling out a Global Strategy for digital service and digitization for Siemens Smart Infrastructure. Siemens SI has over 30,000 employees globally.
		• I have worked in a startup environment where we created and scaled up a data analytics system to over 5 million data points every 5 minutes or less from laptop to fully fledged AWS containerized system servier over 1500 buildings. I am also currently working with Siemens product teams for AWS cloud deployment.
		• I have first hand experience on taking a product from on site proto-type all the way to industrialized cloud based solution
		• My experience has taken me from a local technical level of knowledge to dealing with C suite of billion dollar enterprise customers. A large portion of my current role is to present to enterprise customers around the world.

		I believe I need to expand on the a few key main points, Formal education, more time and experience at a enterprise company, cyber security and more detailed cloud computing knowledge.
		• Formal Education - I am currently completly my Bachelor of IT with an intent to obtain a Master of Business once this is complete.
		• Time and Experience - I am working at a Global HeadQuarters for a large company for close to 2 years now, this has been a large shift from my start up background. I need to expand on this and work in different regions.
