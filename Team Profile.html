		<h1>Personality Tests</h1>
		<h2>Joe</h2>
		<h3>Student ID: S3862471</h3>
		<p>I first became interested in programming when I had to do an assignment on BASIC in year 9 in high school, which led to my talking my parents into buying me a Dick Smith System 80 with 16kB RAM and an audio tape drive. I started programming in BASIC on it, writing various games and working on one in particular that helped me learn about subroutines.
		</p><p>In 1982 I finished a year student exchange program in the USA where I studied BASIC and got 100%. I did a course in Pascal in 1983 and started a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS, then the NSW Institute of Technology) in 1984 where I learned Fortran and dabbled in some other programming languages (Ratfor, Z80 Assembly code, Forth). I had to withdraw from the course before I finished. In 2010 I had another go at Mechanical Engineering, at Sydney University this time. In first semester I did Engineering Computing which covered Matlab. September last year I had to withdraw from the course having completed 89% of it. I have some experience in HTML and had a web site which made use of HTML and CSS but that is gone now. I also started a course on Udemy in writing applications for iOS, but I didn't complete it as I prioritised my university studies.

		<p>While I don't disagree with the description of myself that the Meyers-Briggs Test comes up with, I'm not sure how useful they are for someone who knows themself well. They may be helpful to someone hiring people who has to assess a lot of people they don't know quickly, or for a young person who doesn't know themself that well. It's pretty positive so I don't think it's a problem for job interviews if they test me. The learning style test doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already suspect. IQ tests suffer from problems of cultural bias, although this works in my favour as I am of the culture the tests are aimed at.
		</p><p>For a group it indicates I should be an asset to them. Being organised and natural leader, combined with my experience with HTML and programming should make it easy for me to find people who would like to join forces. I hope to be able to help the team out a lot. Although my ESTJ profile says I'm a natural leader, this is not a position I gravitate towards as it takes a lot of work to do well. All the groups I've been in at university before didn't have a leader and just worked cooperatively anyway.
		
		<h2>Marcus</h2>
		<h3>Student ID: S3735636</h3>
		<p>I am a 22-year-old who has an interest in IT that is only on the surface of what technology can really do. I love video games; I recently built my own gaming PC and I like to work out how things fit together. However, that is as far as my knowledge goes. I have little experience in the technology field with computing and coding and have little use for it in the career I am pursuing. My main hobbies include sports such as basketball, footy and video games.

			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>These personality test results indicate my preference to work individually rather than as a group. In a team environment my introverted personality may mean that I am more suited to doing a personal task and inputting it back to the team once completed. My high scores in perceiving and agreeableness also make me a good team player in that I can easily help out the team and am more than happy to do what the team needs to succeed. My lack of knowledge in the IT department meant that I was little help with the website elements and therefore I used my skills on the research part of the assignment.

		<h2>Murray Lowis</h2>
		<h3>Student ID: S3862651</h3>
		<p>My IT experience to date has been mostly from simply playing around with my own computers and limited free online courses. When it comes to technology, I use I like to explore and test everything I can, whether it be learning new programs or trying new ways to use gadgets. For instance, streaming my computer to the living room then using a Bluetooth PS4 controller with 3rd party software to watch Netflix, or myriad other token exercises.

			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>These personality test results suggest suitability for analytical or creative roles rather than more arduous or repetitive tasks. Developing the project idea and designing the website HTML and CSS elements both require creativity and the website design additionally requires an analytical approach. On these grounds we agreed that I would primarily work on setting up the GitHub website and developing the “Project Idea” section. My introversion also meant that the interview could be better handled by others.

		<h2>Ossama</h2>
		<h3>student ID: S3868543</h3>
		<p>I have always been interested in computing technology for as long as I can remember. Growing up we always had a computer in the house, and I found myself being the go-to person for technology related issues. As time went on and I developed an interest in gaming my competence within computing also expanded as a result. I am nowhere near adept in the area, but my interest and desired career naturally line up as a result.

			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>As someone who is quite familiar with the 16 personalities and big 5 personality tests the results do not come as a surprise to me. The learning style test revealing the majority auditory result was quite a surprise, however. I am not sure what led me to believe that would most likely be my lowest score but upon consideration its extremely obvious to me that it should not. Whenever I solve a math equation, I must spell it out in my mind. Whenever I read, I almost always read each word aloud in my mind and background noise leaves me completely unable to focus. Discovering this has been quite useful as I can manipulate my surroundings to allow myself the best chance at deep concentration. 
		</p><p>Upon inspection of my teammate’s personal profiles it is obvious that we have a very well rounded and diverse team. My own personal shortcomings as mentioned in the big 5 personality test are low conscientiousness and difficulty sticking to routine. This could otherwise bring down a team if it were not for the stable group surrounding me. There are some among us that are agreeable, conscientious, extraverted, or open and some that are the opposite. Such diversity in opinions and traits tend to lead to better functioning teams.

		<h2>Torin</h2>
		<h3>student ID: S3863563</h3>
		<p>My interest in IT goes back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away, taking so long to produce even an image. Limewire and Torrents came next, accidentally downloading viruses onto the family computer, while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. At the local Trash & Treasure I would often find old computers to take apart and check out their insides. Removing the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting. Later in life I found an interest in graphic design, sound engineering and a small amount of coding through internet courses. The graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. My interest in live sound led me to connect two of my passions, technology, and music. Most recently, I have begun to delve into the world of coding, which brought me to this course.

		<p>After taking these tests I can see how they might be helpful within a group setting. Firstly, noting a group member’s extroverted disposition could aid in the decision to promote them to a leadership role, though identifying this would be easy on the initial interaction with said member.
		</p><p>The second most helpful metric to analyse is the turbulence between the tests. While one of my tests reads extroverted, another reads the opposite. This may indicate one of two things, a dubious nature in the group member or misaligned testing criteria. In any case, lending credence to these tests is difficult with such drastic swings in results.

		<h3>student ID: S3756051</h3>
		<p>It is clear to me that I am not a traditional learner, I can be very creative but also doing standard book learning exercises is not my ideal method. I work well in teams and can be very inclusive and attentive to others needs.
		</p><p>I really can work with most groups and can be a good leader or follower, I am good communicator and can bring people along the journey.
		</p><p>A group should form with different personalities and mixing the workload to fit each person. Being inclusive and understanding of skills and preferred tasks will be critical to success.

		<p>Our group has many different test scores and personality traits which may work in our favour as we are all slightly different in the way we approach our learning. There are some, like Murray and Marcus, who are introverted and like to work predominantly alone, while Ossama and Joe have higher scores in extraversion which help them to be outspoken and bring the group together. Murray’s rational thinking helps the group to stay on track whilst Tyson and Ossama’s tendency to focus more on feeling than logic will create a good mix within the group. Between everyone in the group we have at least 2 of every characteristic in the Myers/Briggs Personality tests that were tested for.
		</p><p>Two people found Meyers/Briggs tests that tested for a 5th characteristic, and they had different results for that characteristic, so we’ve probably covered all the bases. This means we have a well-rounded group. Joe’s Meyers/Briggs results suggested he’d make a good leader, but it was Murray who took a de-facto leadership role, reminding people of what still needed to be done, encouraging people to get their contributions in and contribute to the polls for the group name and meeting times, as well as putting together the web site and the report for the group and creating the group GitHub repository.
		</p><p>Overall, the balance of different personality types made the group function well together.

		<h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
		<h2>Joe</h2>
		<p>My ideal job is as a software developer for a company that has products to help people with disabilities. This has become less specific than at the start of this course, and now I am prepared to be flexible and take on pretty well any software developer position if my ideal position isn’t available.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Marcus</h2>
		<p>After receiving feedback from assignment 1 my stance on my ideal job has not changed. I am still looking to work towards financial planning however I have gained an appreciation for more IT-specific skills, which may help me in the future. At first I though that my introverted nature may hold me back, however as I have now worked in the finance industry for 3 years now and have continued my studies I feel that I have put myself in a position to work on this part of myself to reach my potential. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Murray</h2>
		<p>In assignment 1 I stated that I am interested in programming and cybersecurity as potential careers. My opinion has remained mostly the same although I do find myself enjoying the programming side of things. The main thing that attribute that I currently want in a career is at least some degree of creative freedom, which I believe would be easier to attain as a software engineer, though cybersecurity may offer more in the way of diversity.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Ossama</h2>
		<p>After receiving feedback and viewing each other’s ideal jobs and contemplating about the advantages that would aid certain roles within IT, I feel set in my assertion that a helpdesk or customer service role would be best suited for me. Not only does it take advantage of my perceived personality traits, but it also makes use of my experience in the workforce. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Torin</h2>
		<p>After the commencement of Assignment 2, I have more confidence in my ideal job scenario. Though the confidence in my job path has grown I also have investigated more philanthropic careers. With this in mind, I could look at positions that may take my initial idea and connect a more socially conscious attitude toward work
		</p>
		
		<h2>Tyson</h2>
		<p>In assignment 1 I listed the job “Chief Data and Analytics Officer” which is a lofty job that involves a high level of business experience mixed with a high level of technical knowledge. This is what interests me from my 15+ years of work experience.  
		</p><p>I see that myself and Marcus align wanting to take a business topic and IT topic to find the mix of two passions. I believe that working on topics that you truly find interesting to be the first indicator for success. This process has reaffirmed my belief of my first “ideal job”.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Summary and Discussion</h2>
		<p>Upon reviewing member’s ideal jobs some similarities are apparent. Tyson and Marcus both seem to be interested in the business side of IT. Marcus merging IT with finance and Tyson focusing on data analysis and retrieval. Another parallel is between Murray, Joe and Torin. Joe being interested specifically in mobile development, Murray seeking a software engineer role and Torin looking to pursue a lead role in software development. Torin’s high conscientiousness and extraversion will certainly help him in this endeavour.
