		<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Information Technology is an ever-increasing presence in our lives today. The reach of modern technology reaches into almost every facet of our lives. We use it to surf the web, access our money, talk to our family, and store valuable information, but how safe is our data? According to COS online “ attacks on Internet of Things devices <strong>tripled</strong> in the first half of 2019” (<a href="https://bit.ly/2Zoab6l">Top cybersecurity facts, figures and statistics for 2020</a>). As our reliance on technology grows, so do the ways hackers and criminals can find ways to exploit our private data. While cyber-attacks are on the rise, companies in the cybersecurity sector are creating and implementing technologies to resist and combat their advances.
		<p>

		<h2>Phishing and AI</h2>
		<p>Phishing is a type of scam that involves tricking the targeted individual or group, such as a business’s workforce, into voluntarily installing malware or ransomware onto their device. Once the malware is installed the scammer can do as they please with the information stored or connected to those devices. Phishing scams are commonly delivered through an email, disguised as important and valid information, which makes phishing so hard to defend against. “ According to Verizon’s 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, nearly one-third of all data breaches involved phishing in one way or another.”( https://bit.ly/2AhO3lo ). This makes phishing a top priority in cybersecurity.
		</p><p>US Security company Area 1 ( https://bit.ly/2CZCtfV ) has been implementing AI technologies to oppose phishing scams. The company, founded by 3 former NSA employees, uses their cloud-based ‘Horizon’ software to monitor and detect anomalous language, banners, and attachments. A deeper look into Horizon reveals machine learning capabilities and a small pattern analytics engine known as SPARSE. This engine aggregates the entire web and characterises patterns in phishing attacks. In conjunction with their web-crawling service ActiveSensors, phishing is detected early and neutralised before any malware can be installed on the victim’s system. The beauty of AI is, as the collected data Area 1 obtains grows, profiling a cyber attack will become faster and more effective, leaving businesses, employees, and individuals safer to the threats of web use.
		</p>

		<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
		<p>The impact of AI will likely be felt in the next decade as data breaches continue to grow and phishing attacks become more sophisticated. According to a report by the Capgemini Institute, companies are starting to look to AI to aid in protecting their systems. “Overall, close to three-quarters of firms (73%) said they were testing use cases for AI for cybersecurity in some way.” (Capgemini, 2019). While still in its infancy, machine and deep learning technologies like SPARSE and ActiveSensors are the beginning of the push back against phishing scams and data breach activities. Large companies with sensitive information, such as banks and financial institutions will benefit from advancements in AI the most. Due to the pace in which cyber attacks mutate, security companies who lack the foresight to update their software regularly will surely fall behind. Implementing AI will be the marker of successful enterprises of the future.
		</p>

		<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
		<p>While the main demographic of sophisticated security technologies are businesses that protect valuable information, individuals will feel the effects too. The anti-virus software on personal computers will begin implementing similar strategies in defense  gainst phishing attacks. The inner workings of these updated security protocols will likely go unnoticed by the average user, though it will allow a more detailed review of the threats which have been extinguished. Email users will feel safer navigating their inbox, resting easy knowing any potential threats will be highlighted and dutifully wiped out.
		</p>

		<h2>Private Browsers and VPN’s</h2>
		<p>Browsing the internet can be relaxing, entertaining, and everywhere in between. Though with the rise of cyber attacks on internet users, several companies have developed technology to remain anonymous, therefore  guarded, whilst browsing the web. The most common of these is the Virtual Private Network or VPN. A VPN works by rerouting the user’s IP address and presenting a new one to whoever might be trying to identify them. Certain top-tier VPN services such  as NordVPN use an encryption layer to further protect the information being transferred. VPN’s provide a simple and cost-effective way of ensuring privacy online and users are starting to take note. According to Dataprot “ 26% of internet users worldwide have used a VPN service.”( https://bit.ly/2NKrokP ). As this number grows so do ways of circumnavigating the technologies. In March 2018, a hacker managed to briefly infiltrate a NordVPN server. While the company assured there was no identifiable  information leaked to the attacker, they may have been able to observe the server’s traffic. In theory, VPN’s should make the user anonymous as they surf the web, however, they are not without their limitations.
		</p><p>To create a fully secure browsing experience, internet users may have to look further than VPN’s to be confident in their anonymity. Products, such as Google’s Chrome browser, are data mining machines. While using any of the largest browser services,  the internet user can be sure their data is being recorded and monitored. The solution to this is The Tor browser. Tor or ‘The Onion Router’ boasts “the largest, most robust, and most effective metadata-resistant software project”( https://bit.ly/3ghc1gc ). Tor’s software bounces the user’s internet traffic through three layers of randomly selected nodes, obfusticating the identity of the user. Ethically, Tor has received some scrutiny for allowing individuals to remain anonymous while undertaking criminal  activities. As Tor’s FAQ states “Criminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better privacy than Tor provides. Tor aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that.”( https://bit.ly/31KAZk6 ).Tools such as these endow the average internet user anonymity and security, a practice that is ever necessary for the tech age.
		</p>

		<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
		<p>Developments in private browsing are already in effect. An increase in people signing up for VPN services and privacy tools shows the public’s focus is on anonymity online. Software, which tracks and records information such as Google’s entire suite of
		</p><p>programs, will slowly be replaced with a private and tracker free counterpart. Already, the private search engine DuckDuckGo has seen its search traffic almost double between 2017 and 2019 ( https://bit.ly/31V8rEw ) and is expected to continue this trajectory into the future. Work in creating anonymous systems will begin to grow as private browsing becomes the new norm. Those companies who rely on data collection will likely see a loss in customers as competitive privacy conscious companies are born and evolve.
		</p>

		<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
		<p>This will affect the way common people browse the internet. Instead of loading Chrome Browser and searching for Facebook, people will ensure their VPN is active, before loading a private browser such as Tor and using DuckDuckGo to search for their query. The average user will be hypervigilant in protecting their system to any potential trackers or websites hoping to spy on their activities. These programs are soon becoming the lens, through which we see the wide web.
