		<h2>Joe</h1>
		<p>Sites such as Statista [9], JobOutlook [10], and Industry Connect [11] indicate strong ongoing growth in the area of software development and the career path of software developer. Although Joe would ideally like to work in making things more accessible to people with disabilities, he is flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunities in this area that may arise and this should stand him in good stead for work in the future.

		<h2>Marcus</h2>
		<p>According to Burning Glass [12] my ideal role in Financial Planning is not on the list as it requires minimal IT skills.  
		</p><p>The general skills required in my job are similar of that in any IT profession, including communication and organisational skills which are unanimously important today shown by being in the top 3 generic skills in the Burning Glass tool. In this job, you are often working with people who have extremely limited knowledge in finance and therefore communication skills, being able to explain things in a way that the client will understand is extremely important. The top 3 generic skills that are not required within my ideal job are troubleshooting, creativity and mentoring. Troubleshooting is not necessary as it is not a direct part of the job, while creativity is not necessary as financial planning relies mainly on data, research and regulations. 
		</p><p>The top IT skills that are necessary for Financial Planners are Microsoft Windows which was 4th on the list as well as business management and building relationships being extremely important as well. Microsoft Windows is the operating system used by most businesses, while building relationships with your clients is essential to keep current and attract new business. The three highest ranked IT-specific skills outside of my jobs required skill set are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA; all of which were the top 3 IT-specific skills which reinforces the fact that my ideal job does not require a great deal of IT knowledge or skill. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Murray</h2>
		<p>According to Burning Glass [12] my ideal role in software development/engineering is currently among the most in demand within the IT industry. While the specifics vary depending on the nature of the platform as well as the ultimate usage, there appears to be a great deal of variety in suitable roles available.
		</p><p>Preferring to be involved in the physical development of software (as opposed to managing or guiding projects) does somewhat lower my career ceiling though as senior roles tend to move farther away from actual development and more into oversight. A lower ceiling does at least mean more attainable goals and greater flexibility provided I can maintain a diverse skillset with multiple specialisations.
		</p><p>Expertise with multiple programming languages and problem solving/organisational skills are among the most demanded skills which suits me quite well as I intend to make these a staple of my skillset. Active communication and diligence are potential areas for improvement, as to me these have always been more an obligation than a focus.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Ossama</h2>
		<p>As mentioned in Burning Glass [12] the ‘Service Desk Analyst’ job title is the fifth most frequent job posting in the ‘Information Technology’ sector from March 2017 to March 2018. This section of IT is where I believe myself to have the most inherent advantage and interest. Of the 121,997 job postings in Australia and New Zealand of this time frame the most desired generic skill is ‘Communication Skills’ (44,367) which goes hand in hand with my desired job title. ‘Problem solving’ (16,445) is second on the list which is a considerable aspect of the job’s responsibilities as well. ‘Troubleshooting’ (11,471) is also found in sixth place and is the fundamental responsibility of a helpdesk technician. Of the specialised skills in the IT industry ‘Building Relationships’ (2,119), ‘Technical Support’ (1,830) and ‘Customer Service’ (1,411) are all inclusions that relate directly to my desired job title. Given that this type of role is often an entry level position, this ideal job goal is quite a humble one. It sets the bar to a low and achievable level which leaves the door open for future opportunities. Rather than setting a distant goal of multiple years of study and experience I operate much more effectively on short attainable targets that leave room for spontaneous decision making.

		<h2>Torin</h2>
		<p>On reviewing the Burning Glass data [12], I can see the demand for Solutions Architects is the highest of all categories. Technology Lead with my ideal job is the most similar to this category. The general skills this position will require are strong management, communication, verbal and written skills. According to Burning Glass, communication and writing skills ranked very high where leadership and verbal skills were ranked on the lower end of the spectrum.
		</p><p>The IT specific skills relevant to my job are Java, AWS, and PHP. While Java ranked second highest in the Burning Glass research, the remaining skills weren’t mentioned. In another report from Darwin Recruitment, the US has seen people using PHP less but the job demand remains roughly the same [13] Cloud Computing services like AWS are on the rise as well. In the US, Indeed.com has reported a 418% increase in job demand for AWS skills in the last 5 years. [14]
		</p><p>The three highest-ranked general skills not in my ideal job are mentoring, quality assurance and control and being self-starter. The top highest ranked IT specific skills not relevant to my job are SQL, JavaScript and Windows.
		</p><p>After looking over the data, my ideal job scenario seems to be one of the highest generally ranked positions and skills within the current state of the IT industry. I haven’t changed my mind due to this.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Tyson</h2>
		<p>After reviewing the data from Burning Glass [12] my ideal role doesn’t appear in the “Top IT Skills” or “Top IT Job Titles” which is surprising to me. We are seeing a large growth in the data analytics space and I had assumed this would be one of the job titles near the top. I do see some IT Skills and Generic Skills appear like Python and Problem Solving.
		</p><p>After looking at the market I believe that the skills I have already developed and the skills I am attempting to build via this course and other methods are going to put myself to land a job that requires a very specific set of knowledge that isn’t easy to obtain. This of course does limit the amount of jobs I can apply for, but the current shortage of talent will allow me to have advantageous position.
		</p><p>I do believe that expanding on my knowledge to hit some of the IT Skills and Generic Skills categories will have a long term advantage and I plan to focus on gaining more knowledge in the areas: SQL, Linux, Writing and Quality Assurance and Control.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Summary and Discussion</h2>
		<p>Of the skills each member of the group listed there were some similarities mentioned. Joe, Tyson, Murray and Torin’s ideal jobs all involved software development in varying languages and capacities. Ossama and Marcus both showed interest in jobs which involve building relationships and communication with customers and team members. Murray and Tyson both required problem solving to be a part of their job circumstance. Murray and Joe both required programming skills to be implemented in their positions.
