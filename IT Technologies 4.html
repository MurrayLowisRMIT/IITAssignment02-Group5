		<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
		
		<h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
		<p>“Machine Learning” was first used by IBM programmer Arthur Samuel in 1952. Samuel had written a checkers-playing program that “learned” and got better the more it played. He used a technique called “alpha-beta pruning”, which would score the board based on the position of the pieces and either side's chance of winning. This model evolved into the minmax algorithm that is still taught today.” [“Explainer: What Is Machine Learning?, Cal Jeffrey, July 8 2020, https://www.techspot.com/article/2048-machine-learning-explained/].
		</p><p>Machine Learning (ML) is an approach to achieve artificial intelligence through systems that can learn from experience to find patters in data. Machine learning involves teaching a computer to recognise patterns through large amounts of examples, this is different compared to programming specific rules. You can reuse machine learning with different types of data which makes it very powerful. Machine Learning can be considered a subset of Artificial Intelligence. A common expression seen in many places “All machine learning is considered artificial intelligence but not all artificial intelligence is machine learning.” [“Explainer: What Is Machine Learning?, Cal Jeffrey, July 8 2020, https://www.techspot.com/article/2048-machine-learning-explained/]
		</p><p>Machine Learning goal is to predict patterns after training itself on large amounts of data. It takes a large amount of data to train the system, time to learn the pattern and it can find new data that it has not seen before. With time and data machine learning learns from itself.
		</p><p>Today we are seeing a huge growth for Machine Learning, some obvious examples translations, search results, voice assistants, maps etc... This has allowed large amounts of data to be processed and improve these tools beyond belief of the not so distant past.
		</p><p>The biggest inhibitor for machine learning is processing power and data availability. The second data availability is being solved every day with more and more people online and processes slowly being “digitised”.  As data becomes available machine learning enables people to process and understand the data we are accessing, this is a matter of time and not technical limitations. The other issue is processing power at the moment we are hitting caps and Moore’s law has started to slow down. We are now starting to see quantum computing becoming a large topic, fundamentally changing how a computer works, a brief quote to explain quantum computing “The computers that we are currently use are built using transistors and the data is stored in the form of binary 0 and 1. Quantum computers are built using subatomic particles called quantum bits, qubits for short, which can be in multiple states at the same time. The main advantage of quantum computers is that they can perform highly complex operations at supersonic speeds. Thus, they solve problems that are not currently feasible” [“How Quantum Computing & Machine Learning Work Together”, The Martec, June 18th 2020, https://hackernoon.com/how-quantum-computing-machine-learning-work-together-bc61d0f1b3a] . As you can see this means Quantum Computing has the potential to improve Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence beyond belief, as quantum computing becomes widely available and solutions are made to utilise these new computers we will see large amounts of processing power able to handle much larger amounts of data then what is possible today.
		</p><p>Some discussion around what is possible with the combination of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning. One of the most interesting solution would be real time language processing, many devices today are already able to do this to a high level but with Quantum Computing it would be as fast as the human ear on processing information and changing it another language. This could be done for speaking as well and even take into account tone and inflections. This could completely remove the gap of language between people.

		<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
		<p>Machine Learning has a large impact on the world today already taking tasks such as:
		</p><p>Translation – Tools have already been used to take the jobs of many translators but not all of course. It doesn't solve all the problems of translation but does a large amount of work for the majority.
		</p><p>Search Results – Search engines have never been quicker or better with the use of machine learning large amounts of data has been able to be processed and organised to a very high level of accuracy.
		</p><p>Data Processing – Data processing used to be a manual job for a large amount of people, every day this is becoming less and less of a problem.
		</p><p>Self-Driving Cars – As mentioned in another technology review self-driving cars are growing area of business with Machine Learning playing a large part of this development.
		</p><p>We are seeing tasks being replaced and in some cases jobs, the risk for our society sits with how we handle the jobs being replaced and not so much the tasks. Many companies are starting to predict that within the next 10 years that vehicle drivers such as truck drivers, taxi/uber drivers etc... this equates to a large portion of our current workforce. A study by pwc indicates that this will put 44% of workers with low education at risk. [“How will automation impact jobs?”, PWC John Hawksworth and Euan Cameron January 18th 2020, https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics/insights/the-impact-of-automation-on-jobs.html ]
		</p><p>Unlike other technical advancement this isn't a case of creating new jobs while taking others. Machine learning has a very large ability to scale with processing power and data and as mentioned earlier this is starting to not be a problem with advances in computing.
		</p>
		<h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
		<p>Machine learning has the ability to change how everything we do in daily life. Everything from transportation, food delivery, information processing, manual tasks. It will have a wide-reaching influence and be a touch point for everyday life.
		</p><p>Personally, I work in an industry that has not been touched by the modern technology we see in today's world. This is starting to change as more data is being made available, we are starting to see highly technical tasks becoming more and more likely to be replaced by machine learning. Labour in the building industry historically has been very specific to each building and always needed on site, as we start to see an ageing workforce we are getting less technical people replacing the onsite staff. Technology has been the tool people are latching on to replace these resources, to date we are seeing more advanced rules based programming being the largest part but now with more data available machine learning is playing a large part and starting to effect how processes that have been in place for 30+ years are now being changed to rely on machine learning to find a problem through pattern recognition and instead of routine based checks on physical equipment being told when it needs to be repaired and if its working at 100% efficiency.
		</p><p>My industry isn't the only one being affected, family members work transportation and courier company. This industry is at a high risk of change with self-driving cars and delivery predicted to being solve in the near future. This could replace a large portion of the workforce and not just tasks but complete jobs without creating new jobs that can utilised the existing workforce.
