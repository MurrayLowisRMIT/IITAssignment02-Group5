		<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>

		<p>Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that don’t need a human to manually drive it. They operate by “leveraging various integrated technologies, including but not limited to artificial intelligence, sensors, big data, IoT connectivity, and cloud computing” [Siemens Digital Industries Software n.d, Autonomous Vehicles (AV), viewed 14 July 2020, <https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/our-story/glossary/autonomous-vehicles/46607>]. Essentially, driverless cars are “designed to be capable of 3 things”: sensing, thinking and acting.
		</p><p>Years ago this would have sounded ludicrous, however in recent years there have been astronomical improvements in the world of autonomous vehicles, so much so that you can actually buy a car that is in stage 3 of automation already.
		</p><p>There are essentially 6 ‘levels of automation’ [English, T 2020, ‘The Future of Autonomous Cars Is Bright’, Interesting Engineering, viewed 14 July 2020, <https://interestingengineering.com/the-future-of-autonomous-cars-is-bright>] on the road to being fully driverless.

				<li><p>Full Automation</p>
			</ol>

		<p>Stage 1 involves no automation at all. Everything from winding the windows up and down to shifting the gears was all done manually.
		</p><p>Stage 2, or ‘driver assistance’ includes a small amount of assistance with things such as steering and braking. We are now past this stage and have moved mostly into stage 3.
		</p><p>Stage 3, or ‘partial automation’ is our current stage within society. There are several automated functions such as parking on their own (in some cars) and some cars can even drive on their own for a period on highways, as seen with Tesla’s autopilot function.
		</p><p>Stage 4, or ‘conditional automation’ is the next stage of automation that we have yet to reach. This is where all driving functions are autonomous, however you can still take over the steering wheel.
		</p><p>Stage 5, or ‘high automation’ is where there is no driver necessary and the car work fully on its own.
		</p><p>Stage 6 involves full automation with no driver’s seat and no steering wheel.
		</p><p>I think within the next 3 years, especially now with covid-19 continuing to slow the economy, autonomous vehicles may take a back seat. The next stage is for all driving to be automated within a car, which has already been attained by several technology companies across the globe. However, the hardest thing for these companies to make an impact will be for them to try and obtain consumer trust.
		</p><p>That is the biggest test for autonomous cars. Consumer trust. Even though there is resounding evidence that majority of deaths associated with cars is human error, people are still very hesitant to put their trust in technology.
		</p><p>The further development of autonomous vehicles will be astronomical. There is so much potential in self driving vehicles, now more than ever. Lives will be saved through the elimination of human error on the roads, quality of life for the elderly will increase exponentially due to them now having access to driverless cars to get around and the economy in general will benefit.
		</p><p>You may even be able to be on your phone while ‘driving’ or have a beer and not be a danger to society. This is a world I want to live in!
		</p><p>There may however be negative affects to this situation. There are people who believe that there are “ethical and psychological concerns about their behaviour in critical, non-routine traffic situations that potentially involve fatalities” [Frank, D-A, Chrysochou, P, Mitkidis, P & Ariely, D 2019, ‘Human decision-making biases in the moral dilemmas of autonomous vehicles’ Nature, viewed 16 July 2020, <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49411-7>.]. For example, what is an autonomous vehicle going to do when faced with a decision hit a 4-year-old child or a 65-year-old man? Every person is different, but it poses the question. What is the right answer? This is the greatest steppingstone that these researchers and companies need to figure out.
		</p><p>People most affected by this will be people who drive for a job, truck, tram, taxi drivers among them. These are jobs that will now be replaced or made redundant; however, it may also create jobs as well.
		</p><p>Jobs in the technology industry will increase as more and more IT specialists will be required by car manufacturing companies who want to compete. IT is and will be a huge part of our future and so jobs in this field are only set to grow from any technological advances into the future.
		</p><p>This will not affect my day to day life at all. I hardly drive at all as I live in a small country town and work 2 minutes away and so this will not affect me for some time. However, several family members live and work in the city and so for them life will change drastically.
		</p><p>Soon enough, for people living in urban areas, the number of autonomous vehicles on the roads will increase essentially giving people more time in their day to work or play. Trams will be automated and so will trains. Travelling long distances to visit family and friends will be much more enjoyable and easy once vehicles are autonomous.
		</p><p>I feel there are 3 main things to take away when thinking about autonomous vehicles:
		</p><p>Safety – we know that many deaths on the roads are caused by human error which may be eliminated with autonomous vehicles and make our roads safer than ever.
		</p><p>Convenience – for most people, driving is a chore. We aren’t excited about getting in the car but we do it because it’s the easiest way to get to and from work. If we no longer have to drive the car and we are essentially another passenger, think of the things you can do on the way to work now that you once could not. Do your makeup, catch up on the morning news, watch your favourite tv show. The possibilities are endless.
		</p><p>Cost – autonomous vehicles will be expensive. There’s no doubt about that, in fact in my opinion most of the population won’t be able to afford one of these automated vehicles for quite some time.
